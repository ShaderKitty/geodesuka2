\chapter{Preface}
The original intent of this engine was to utilize OpenGL and OpenCL in such a way that the engine API would treat them indistringuishable. Sadly, the state machine of OpenGL did not play well with the command queue nature of OpenCL. Vulkan as a Graphics and Compute API is proving to be the better option in the case that it is easy to batch command buffers for arbitrary execution on the gpu as opposed to the just in time state machine of OpenGL.
