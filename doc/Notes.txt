Currently the plan is to add mod support for game makers to allow users of the engine to dll
inject mods into the game without revealing backend for the code in the first place. All assets
should be in the assets directory, purely for reference and static use. The appdata folder will
serve as the folder where saves and so on will go. The "mods" folder will serve as the place where
dynamic library modding will be supported. Extending object functionality without exposing the main
game source code.
